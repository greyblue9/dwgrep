dwgrep is a tool for querying Dwarf (debuginfo) graphs.  Queries are
written in a language called Zwerg, the syntax of which is described
in doc/syntax.rst.  The engine itself is available as a shared library
which can be used from C.

Full documentation is available in the doc/ sub-directory.  In particular,
