* version 0.3 [2017-12-09 Sat]

** Backward-incompatible Changes

  - Change parsing of integer literals. Integer literals are now seqences of
    alphanumeric characters that start with a decimal digit (e.g. 123, 0xff),
    whereas before, they were seqences of characters indicated by the number
    prefix (e.g. 0x indicated [0-9a-f] as appropriate character set).

    Thus apparent typos such as "0b123" are not parsed as "0b1" followed by "23"
    anymore, but as "0b123", which is flagged as error. Likewise strings such as
    "123drop", which were previously valid, are not anymore.

** Other Changes

  - dwgrep can now dump location lists.

  - Small changes to the C API and a lot of documentation. The API in still
    unstable and preliminary.

  - Fix building on GCC 4.8 and 7.0.
    - Fixes #28: Include <functional> header for std::function

  - Rework how variable binding works. There should be no user-visible changes
    for programs that were not relying on undocumented behavior.
    - Fixes #25: Frame cloning too expensive

  - Error messages are now printed to stderr, not stdout.

  - Fix --help to include full first sentence of option description, and not
    stop at the first period.


* version 0.2 [2015-02-28 Sat]

  - ELF symbol tables are supported.  New word `symbol` applicable to
    DWARF value yields ELF symbols.  Words `label`, `value`,
    `address`, `name`, `size` `binding`, `visibility` operate on ELF
    symbols.

  - C API is considerably more complete, and now used exclusively by
    the "dwgrep" command-line driver to communicate with libzwerg.  It
    is however still not considered stable and is undocumented.

  - The word `length` is now applicable to location lists.

  - Bug fixes (issues #5, #6, #7, #8, #14, #15, #16, #17, #22, #26).


* version 0.1 [2014-12-10 Sun]

  - Initial release.
